[Vaccine Records across the world from 28th Jan., 2022- 28th Jan., 2022 (Dataset from Google).txt](https://github.com/ProTeni/GeoMap-Dataset-from-Google-Trend/files/8054008/Vaccine.Records.across.the.world.from.28th.Jan.2022-.28th.Jan.2022.Dataset.from.Google.txt)

Questions I was curiously queried the dataset on:
1.1. What are the top 10 countries in the world with the highest Covid-19 vaccine exercise between Jan 2021 and Jan 2022?

2. What are the top 3 countries with the least vaccine exercise?

3. How many vaccine doses have been administered between the date range?

4. Which countries didn't have any vaccine record? Why? was it due to lack if resources to the vaccines 
	or simply because they had no COVID record in the country?

5. In a sentence, state the country and the number of vaccines that were adminstered within given the date range
